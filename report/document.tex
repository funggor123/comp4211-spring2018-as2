\subsection{Hold out validation result of CNN classifier from scratch}

The following are the hold out validation results of CNN classifier from scratch. The network archiecture of using in the hold out validation was the same as the snapshot above. In the validation, we partitioned the training set into the training and validation sets with ratio 4:1. For each candidate set of hyperparameters, we trained the network for $20$ epochs batch size $32$ and validate it against the validation set. The cross entropy loss on validation set shown in the results table was the optimal one .

\end{table}

The cross entropy loss of parameters set $4$ had the lowest optimal cross entropy loss $410.54719$ after conducting the hold out validation, so we would choose the parameters set $[Adam, 0.001, 64]$ as the hyperparameters for the training in the testing phase.


\subsection{Hold out validation result of the CNN classifier with Pretrained Encoder Weights}

The following are the hold out validation results of the CNN classifier with pretrained encoder weights. The network archiecture of using in the hold out validation was the same as the snapshot above. In the validation, we partitioned the training set into the training and validation sets with ratio 4:1. For each candidate set of hyperparameters, we trained the network for $20$ epochs batch size $32$ and validate it against the validation set.  The cross entropy loss on validation set shown in the results table was the optimal one .

The cross entropy loss of parameters set $5$ had the lowest optimal cross entropy loss $636.57846$ after conducting the hold out validation, so we would choose the parameters set $[SGD, 0.1, 64]$ as the hyperparameters for the training in the testing phase.


\subsection{Testing Results of CNN Classifier}

In the testing phase, for both CNN classifier from scratch and with Pretrained Encoder Weights, we trained using the entire training set with the best set of hyperparameters obtained from the hold out validation and the same network architecture as the hold out validation, and tested with the testing test. We used $32$ as our batch size and trained with $20$ epoch. And we had repeated the same process for $5$ rounds. The below was the results.

The following was the learning curve of the testing metric that we randomly selected only one run out of the total of five runs. The blue color curve was results on testing set and the orange color curve was the results on training set. (The diagram on the left hand side was the results drawn from CNN classifier from scratch and the right hand side was the results drawn from the CNN classifier with Pretrained Encoder Weights )

From the square loss histogram of test sets, we found out that the mean squared error of the most of the data points are around zero. It means that this model perform quite well for most of the data points. However, for the finance datasets, there are some data points that have the sqaured error far away from zero ($23.77581$) which means that there might be some \textbf{outliers} that far away from the curve.
